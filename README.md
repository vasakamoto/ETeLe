# Introduction 
This project is reserved to the development of a tool (that for now will be a CLI tool,
knowing the future is not reserved to the contemplation of mortals). There are alternatives
? For sure there are plenty, but the intent of this project is beyond to generalize 
requests from RESTful APIs, this is a study project too, learn more stuff about HTTP 
protocols, DSA, design, etc.

For now, there isn't much to explain about.
